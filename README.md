# shaderfish

This started as a tesselation for fish using three.js, but somehow
it turned into a workshop for fragment shaders and ray marching...

Not sure how it happened.

Escher-fish-tesselation using bezier curves and vertex shaders in three.js

# Run

## Install deps

```npm install```

## Run

```npm run dev```

Just edit the shaders (the glsl files) and the results will reload automatically.
