      This gets a bit more fancy. 
      We are only drawing a circle, it looks flat, but that
      is mostly lightning being very naive and coming later...

      Now we are marching along rays out of the camera. We are calculating the distance from <thead>
      ray to the nearest object using the distance function of the world.
      We only march along the ray as long as the distance is to some object nearby.
